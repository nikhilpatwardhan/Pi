PI
===============================================================================
This is just a fun repository, exploring various ways to compute the value of
Pi and analyse them for time taken, accuracy etc. One of the objectives is also
to generate Pi to 1 million digits in a reasonable amount of time.

Due to floating point limitations, pi can only be stored accurately
up to 15 decimal places on a 64-bit OS. E.g. although the real value of pi is
3.141592653589793238462643383279502884197169399375105820974944592307816406286

what gets stored is
3.1415926535897931159979634685441851615905761718750000
-----------------xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

So as far as the compuation of pi using basic datatypes is concerned, it is
not useful to go beyond an accuracy of 15 decimal places.

Compute and plot time taken and accuracy of calcs for increasing N
